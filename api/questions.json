            "question": "Marine archaeologists have found much of the wooden hull of a sixteenth-century ship in a flooded quarry in southeast England. When it is exposed to air and water, wood rots quickly unless it is protected by sediment that shields it from oxygen. Therefore, the discovered ship was likely ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
            "choice_a": "covered by a protective sediment layer in the quarry.",
            "choice_b": "one of several other ships buried in the same quarry.",
            "choice_c": "a confirmation of previous theories about the type of wood that was used in sixteenth-century ships.",
            "choice_d": "first constructed much earlier than previously thought.",
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the discovered ship. The text states that much of the ship\u2019s wooden hull was found in a quarry. The text also states that wood rots quickly unless it is protected by sediment, which shields the wood from exposure to oxygen. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the surviving portion of the ship\u2019s hull was covered by an oxygen-shielding layer of sediment. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests other ships have been or are likely to be found in the same quarry. The fact that much of this ship\u2019s wood survived for centuries in the quarry does raise the possibility that there might be other preserved ships, but the text provides no support for such a conclusion. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not address the type of wood used in sixteenth-century ships or any theories pertaining to wood choice in ships. Choice D is incorrect because the text states only that the ship is from the sixteenth century, with no other dates offered for its construction, and thus there is no basis to consider alternative ages for the ship. Additionally, even if the ship was constructed earlier, it is not logically connected to the text\u2019s discussion of how it was preserved.",

            "question": "Parthenogenesis is a form of reproduction in which a female reproduces without mating. She produces an egg containing a single offspring whose DNA, or genetic material, comes entirely from its mother. Among birds, parthenogenesis has been found in a handful of species, including pigeons and turkeys. When scientists at the San Diego Zoo analyzed the DNA of the zoo\u2019s California condors (a species of vulture), they discovered that two individuals weren\u2019t genetically similar enough to any of the males in the condor enclosure to be their offspring. However, both had hatched from eggs laid by females in the enclosure. Thus, the scientists concluded that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?",
            "choice_a": "at least one of those individuals\u2019 mothers was born as a result of parthenogenesis.",
            "choice_b": "California condors may reproduce through parthenogenesis in zoos but not in the wild.",
            "choice_c": "the mothers of the two individuals probably reproduced through parthenogenesis.",
            "choice_d": "California condors reproduce through parthenogenesis only if females lack sufficient access to males.",
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of parthenogenesis as it relates to two California condors at the San Diego Zoo. The text explains that parthenogenesis is a form of reproduction in which a female reproduces without mating, producing an egg containing an offspring with DNA that comes entirely from its mother. After noting examples of parthenogenesis among birds, the text then reports on a discovery at the San Diego Zoo. According to the text, scientists at the zoo found that two of the zoo\u2019s California condors weren\u2019t similar enough to any of the zoo\u2019s male condors to be their offspring. Given that parthenogenesis occurs without mating and results in an offspring with DNA entirely from its mother, it can reasonably be inferred that the scientists concluded that the mothers of the two condors probably didn\u2019t mate with any of the male condors at the zoo, reproducing through parthenogenesis instead. Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that at least one of the condors\u2019 mothers was born as a result of parthenogenesis. Rather, the text suggests that the two condors were themselves both probably born as a result of parthenogenesis, which would account for their lack of strong genetic resemblance to any of the male condors in the zoo\u2019s condor enclosure. Choice B is incorrect because the text never discusses wild California condors, only California condors living at the San Diego Zoo. For this reason, the text doesn\u2019t support a conclusion that distinguishes between how California condors reproduce in zoos and how they reproduce in the wild. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that the zoo\u2019s female condors lacked sufficient access to males or that this would be a cause of parthenogenesis, indicating only that the condor enclosure included males.",
